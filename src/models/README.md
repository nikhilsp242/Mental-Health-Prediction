## 1. dl_models.py
This code defines a deep learning model (`DLModel`) for text classification tasks. Here's a brief overview:

- **Initialization:**
  - Inherits from `nn.Module`.
  - Accepts a configuration (`DLModelConfig`).
  - Initializes an embedding layer and a classifier based on the provided configuration.

- **Forward Method:**
  - Takes input token IDs (`ids`) and their lengths (`lens`).
  - Passes the token IDs through the embedding layer.
  - The output of the embedding layer is then fed into the classifier.
  - The classifier produces logits, which represent the unnormalized predictions for each class.
  - Returns the logits.

This structure allows you to easily configure and swap different embedding layers and classifiers based on the requirements of your text classification task.

## 2. embedding_layer.py
This code defines different types of embedding layers for text data:

1. **`EmbeddingLayer` Class:**
   - Base class for embedding layers.
   - Initializes with a specified configuration (`EmbeddingLayerConfig`).
   - Defines a forward method, but it raises a `NotImplementedError` since it should be implemented by subclasses.

2. **`StaticEmbeddingLayer` Class (Subclass of `EmbeddingLayer`):**
   - Inherits from `EmbeddingLayer`.
   - Adds functionality for static word embeddings.
   - Initializes an embedding layer using `nn.Embedding` based on the provided dictionary and dimension.
   - Optionally loads pretrained word embeddings from a file.
   - Implements the forward method to return the embeddings for input tokens.

3. **`BertEmbeddingLayer` Class (Subclass of `EmbeddingLayer`):**
   - Inherits from `EmbeddingLayer`.
   - Adds functionality for BERT embeddings using the Hugging Face Transformers library.
   - Initializes a BERT model from pretrained weights.
   - Implements the forward method to return the last hidden states from the BERT model for input tokens.

These embedding layers can be used as components in a larger deep learning model for natural language processing tasks.
