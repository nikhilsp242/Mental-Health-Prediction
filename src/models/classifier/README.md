Immporting the following :

  - from .mrnn import MRNNClassifier

## 2. base.py
The code you provided defines a generic `Classifier` class as a PyTorch `nn.Module`. This class is designed to be subclassed to create specific classifiers for various tasks. Here are the key components of the `Classifier` class:

### `Classifier` Class:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The class inherits from `nn.Module`, indicating that it is a PyTorch neural network module.
   - The `__init__` method initializes the classifier with a configuration object (`ClassifierConfig`), which likely contains hyperparameters and settings for the classifier.

2. **`forward` Method:**
   - The `forward` method is declared as an abstract method (`NotImplementedError` is raised).
   - Subclasses of this `Classifier` class must override the `forward` method with their specific implementation.
   - The `forward` method typically defines the forward pass of the neural network, specifying how input data is processed to produce output predictions.

## 3. components.py

### `RNN` Class:
- **Initialization:**
  - Represents an RNN layer.
  - Supports different RNN types: "RNN," "GRU," "LSTM."
  - Initializes the RNN layer with specified configurations (e.g., input size, hidden size, number of layers, bidirectionality).

- **Forward Method:**
  - Handles variable-length sequences using packed sequences.
  - If sequence lengths (`seq_lengths`) are provided, sorts inputs based on sequence lengths, packs them, and applies the RNN.
  - Extracts the last hidden state of the RNN, considering bidirectionality.
  - Reverts the order of sequences to their original order if sequence lengths are used.

### `AttentionLayer` Class:
- **Initialization:**
  - Implements an attention layer.
  - Takes input dimensions and attention dimensions as parameters.
  - Uses linear layers to compute attention logits.

- **Forward Method:**
  - Applies attention mechanism to the input sequences.
  - Computes attention logits and applies a masking operation based on sequence lengths.
  - Computes attention weights using softmax.
  - Applies attention weights to input sequences and returns the context vector.

These classes are designed for use in neural network architectures, particularly in natural language processing tasks where variable-length sequences and attention mechanisms are common.

## 4. mrnn.py
This is an implementation of the MRNN (Max-pooling Recurrent Neural Network) classifier. Here's a brief overview:

- **Initialization:**
  - Inherits from the `Classifier` base class.
  - Accepts a configuration (`MRNNClassifierConfig`).
  - Configures the MRNN components: RNN, Batch Normalization, MLP, and Output Layer.

- **Forward Method:**
  - Takes an input embedding and sequence lengths (`seq_lens`).
  - Applies zero-padding to the input vectors to handle sequences with a window of size `window_size`.
  - Iterates over the input sequence, applying the RNN to each window of size `window_size`.
  - Applies batch normalization and an MLP to the RNN outputs.
  - Uses max-pooling over the sequence length dimension.
  - Applies the output layer to obtain the final classification result.

This architecture is designed to capture sequential patterns using the RNN over local windows, and the max-pooling operation helps aggregate the most relevant information.

## 5. rnn.py
This is an implementation of an RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) classifier with an optional attention mechanism. Here's a brief overview:

- **Initialization:**
  - Inherits from the `Classifier` base class.
  - Accepts a configuration (`RNNClassifierConfig`).
  - Configures the RNN components based on the provided configuration.
  - Sets up a dropout layer and an output layer.

- **Forward Method:**
  - Takes an input embedding and sequence lengths (`seq_lens`).
  - Applies the RNN to the input sequence.
  - If attention is enabled (`use_attention` is True), applies an attention mechanism (`AttentionLayer`) to the RNN outputs.
  - If attention is not used, the last hidden state of the RNN is used as the context.
  - Passes the context through a dropout layer.
  - Applies the output layer to obtain the final logits for classification.

This architecture allows for flexibility with or without attention, providing a mechanism to capture different types of dependencies in the input sequence.
