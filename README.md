# Mental Health Prediction

### Here are some key components and aspects from the project:

1. **Model Architecture:**
   - We have implemented several deep learning models for mental health status classification, such as RNN-based classifiers, Memory-Augmented RNNs, and attention-based models.
   - The models are defined using PyTorch, and we have different configurations for each model type.

2. **Training and Evaluation:**
   - We have a `DLTrainer` class that provides methods for training, evaluating, and testing the deep learning models.
   - The training loop includes functionality for early stopping, model checkpointing, and saving/loading models.

3. **Configuration Management:**
   - We use configuration files to define and instantiate various components of your project, such as models, optimizers, and data loaders.
   - The `config` module helps with managing and creating instances of configurations.

4. **Data Processing:**
   - We tokenize and preprocess text data, and you have functions for converting text data into tensors.
   - There's a focus on handling data from social media, and the code includes functions for tokenization and sequence length manipulation.

5. **Utility Functions:**
   - Utility functions for loading and saving raw data, creating a tokenizer, and calculating accuracy or F1 score are included.

6. **Data Loader:**
   - Data loading is handled with PyTorch data loaders, and you have a mechanism for building data loaders from raw data.

7. **Configuration and Model Selection:**
   - We have a system for selecting models and configurations based on provided configuration files.
   - There's a mapping between configuration classes and the actual class implementations.
